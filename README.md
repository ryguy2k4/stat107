# stat107
Coursework for STAT 107 (Data Science Discovery) at UIUC. I took this course during the Fall 2023 semester.

## Course Description
Data Science Discovery is the intersection of statistics, computation, and real-world relevance. As a project-driven course, students perform hands-on-analysis of real-world datasets to analyze and discover the impact of the data. Throughout each experience, students reflect on the social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.
