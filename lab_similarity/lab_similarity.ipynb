    "A lot of wonderful course staff work together to bring you all the content for Data Science Discovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course staff of 107 consists of the **Professors, TAs, and CAs**. As you saw in the previous parts, they've all completed the Hello Survey too! \n",
    "\n",
    "Their response under the `name` column is standardized and follows these formats:\n",
    "- `Prof. [Name]`,\n",
    "- `TA [Name]`, or\n",
    "- `CA [Name]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `contains` function will come in handy for us once again, because we can see if `\"CA \"`, `\"TA \"`, or `\"Prof. \"` is in the **names** of any rows in our DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `contains` function, create a **new DataFrame** with just the course staff: `df_staff`. \n",

    "Part of the statement has been completed for you to show you how to use `contains`. Complete it.\n",

    "*Note that we have to cast our `Name` column of `df` to a **string** by using `.str`."
